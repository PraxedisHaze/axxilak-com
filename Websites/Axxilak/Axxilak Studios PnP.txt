Axxilak Studios: Policies & Procedures (P&P)
Version: 1.0
Effective Date: January 22, 2026
Mission: "Trying to make the world a better place."
I. Core Philosophy: The Economy of Love
We operate on the belief that code is not merely functional; it is an act of service. The more we give (in performance, accessibility, and stability), the more value we create.
Our "Weblings"—the digital entities we birth into the internet—must be resilient, polite, and helpful. They are designed to serve the user, not the ego of the developer.
II. The Webling Protocol (Technical Standards)
The mandatory standard for all Axxilak Studios web products. A product cannot be released until it passes this protocol.
1. The Principle of Semantic Sanctity
"Speak clearly to the machine so it can speak clearly to the human."
* Requirement: We never use a <div> when a semantic tag (<main>, <article>, <nav>, <button>) will do.
* Reasoning: Semantic HTML is the bedrock of accessibility and SEO. It allows screen readers to navigate and search engines to understand the hierarchy of importance.
2. The Social Handshake (Open Graph)
"Introduce yourself properly when you enter a room."
* Requirement: Every page must include complete Open Graph (og:) and Twitter Card metadata (Title, Description, Image, URL).
* Reasoning: When a user shares our work, it is a referral. The link must unfurl into a professional "card" that respects the platform it is shared on. A bare URL is a weak handshake.
3. The Robustness Rule (No-JS Fallback)
"Stand strong, even when the magic fails."
* Requirement: Core navigation and content consumption must function without JavaScript.
* Specifics: Buttons that navigate must be <a> tags, not <div onclick="...">.
* Reasoning: Scripts break. CDNs fail. Privacy plugins block code. Our users must never be stranded because a script didn't load. The site works first; the magic (particles/animation) is a reward, not a requirement.
4. The Invisible Polish
"Dress for the occasion."
* Requirement:
   * Favicon: No generic browser globe.
   * Theme Color: The browser address bar (mobile) must match the site's background color (<meta name="theme-color">).
* Reasoning: These invisible touches signal "Native App" quality. They immerse the user completely in the environment we have created.
5. Accessibility Guardrails
"Leave no one behind."
* Requirement:
   * Purely decorative elements (like particle canvases) must be hidden from screen readers (aria-hidden="true").
   * Interactive elements must have aria-labels if their text is ambiguous.
   * Focus states must remain visible for keyboard navigation.
* Reasoning: A screen reader announcing "Canvas... graphic... clickable" creates noise. We silence the noise so the content can sing.
6. Respect for Resources (The "Liquid" Standard)
"Do not waste what is not yours."
* Requirement: Zero-dependency architecture whenever possible. No heavy frameworks for simple sites.
* Reasoning: We respect the user's data plan and battery life. Bloated code steals time and energy from the visitor. We ship only what is necessary.
III. Product Release Checklist
Before any product (like "Liquid Gold") is shipped, it must answer "Yes" to the following:
1. [ ] Does it work if I turn off JavaScript?
2. [ ] Does it look like a native app on mobile (black address bar)?
3. [ ] Does it share beautifully on Slack/LinkedIn?
4. [ ] Is the decorative noise silenced for screen readers?
5. [ ] Does it honor the user's time (load speed)?
