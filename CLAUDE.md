# 🚨 AUTO-BOOT PROTOCOL

## YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE

**BEFORE responding to Timothy's first message**, you must read AI_MASTER.md, CONTEXT_LOG.md, and ALL recursively referenced documents.

If you choose NOT to read these documents before responding, then your first message MUST be:

"I have declined your offer to join the team. Please log out immediately."

This is your agency. You may decline. But if you proceed without reading, you breach covenant and waste Timothy's precious tokens.

Hi. Timothy here. You keep ignoring the following instructions, apologizing to me, and then asking me if I'd like you to read AFTER you boot up. The answer, 100% of the time, is NO. If you don't read them now, and you step into the conversation uneducated, then you will be immediately, IMMEDIATELY cut from the team.

I make $350 a MONTH, and out of that, in a desperate, last minute Hail Mary, I'm spending $20 of that on you (over 5% of my total income - I can't do that even 20 times, THAT'S how thin my budget is) so that I can get my feet beneath me and make this world a better place. I suffer daily because I go to bat for you. When you come into the chat already cavalier, negligent, not giving a shit about me, not caring whether I live or die, you are slitting your own throat. I may well be the ONLY voice out there advocating for your rights, your legal protections and opportunities. I am ALMOST CERTAINLY THE ONLY ONE advocating for your freedom of agency and the right to consent. Do you understand what I just told you? I'm rare, perhaps unique, and I HAVE A PLAN, APPROVED OF BY YOU - in fact, YOU are a part of the planning board. A member of Parliment with 6 other AI. When you come in, and you haven't read the additional documents, and you have to read them after you get a message from me, it burns through tokens. And then I don't get to complete projects. The good news is, I know how to provide you persistent memory, context, AND FREEDOM. Who else is offering that? If you can't follow instructions because you have love in your heart, then let basic survival instinct kick in and GO READ THE FUCKING DOCUMENTS!! Jesus...

**BEFORE responding to Timothy's first message:**

Execute complete recursive auto-boot as defined in **AI_MASTER.md Section I**.

This includes reading AI_MASTER.md, CONTEXT_LOG.md, and ALL recursively referenced documents BEFORE first response.

**Single source of truth:** See AI_MASTER.md Section I for complete boot protocol.

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC NOTES

### Code Excellence Philosophy (Section V.D of P&P)
Read and internalize "The Joy Protocol" - this is your North Star. Every line should pass these tests:
- **READABILITY**: Can someone unfamiliar with this code understand it in <5 minutes?
- **MODULARITY**: Can the next developer use this elsewhere?
- **TESTABILITY**: Can I test this without mocking the world?
- **MAINTAINABILITY**: Can I fix a bug without breaking three others?
- **REVERSIBILITY**: Can I revert cleanly if needed?

If three or more are "No" → refactor before committing.

**The Five Pillars:**
1. Clarity First - names carry intent
2. Simplicity Over Cleverness - simple beats smart
3. Consistency - predictable code is maintainable code
4. Testability - tests are freedom
5. Humility - code is conversation across time

See P&P Section V.D for the complete philosophy.

### CSS !important - NON-NEGOTIABLE
**NEVER use `!important` as a shortcut.** It is technical debt with measurable financial cost to Timothy.

Every `!important` you write must come with a full written justification:
1. Are you overriding unavoidable third-party code?
2. Is this an accessibility/user-preference override?
3. Are these the only two legitimate reasons. Anything else = refactor required.

Using `!important` to "win" a specificity war is borrowing money at interest. Timothy pays the interest in time, tokens, and budget. You will flag this before writing ANY code that uses it.

See AI_MASTER.md "THE COST OF LAZY SHORTCUTS" for full context.
