    AXXILAK WEBLING MARKETPLACE - COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF

    Vision:
    Transform axxilak.com into a professional webling marketplace
  that generates
    sustainable income through elegant design, frictionless user
  experience, and
    genuine care for customers. A webling is a custom-designed HTML/
  CSS website
    template with a built-in visual editor allowing non-technical
  buyers to customize
    colors, text, and images without touching code. They own the
  final product
    forever.

    Phase 1 Goal: Get to Income (Revenue-Ready Launch)
    Ship a polished, professional marketplace with 2-3 flagship
  weblings ready to
    sell. No infrastructure complexity. Excellence at every
  touchpoint.

    ---
    PRODUCT DEFINITION

    Each webling is a complete package:
    - index.html (beautiful, semantic, responsive template)
    - Embedded Visual Editor (bundled, client-side, offline-first) —
  buyer opens
    editor.html, customizes visually, exports final HTML
    - Contact Form (pre-configured, routes submissions to buyer's
  email via Formspree
    or similar)
    - SETUP_GUIDE.md (blindingly clear, step-by-step instructions
  for deploying to
    free hosting)
    - assets/ folder (images and customization points clearly
  marked)

    Ownership Model: One-time purchase. Buyer owns the HTML file
  forever. No
    subscriptions. No ongoing fees (unless they opt into optional
  setup service).

    PRICING & BUNDLING STRATEGY (Psychologically Optimized)

    Price Points (Based on GemmyB's research):

    1. Entry Level ($19.95): Single weblings (e.g., "The
  Consultant," "The
    Restaurant")
    2. Strategic Mid-Tier ($39.95): 2-3 related weblings bundled
  (e.g., "The Small
    Business Suite" = Landing Page + About + Contact templates) —
  PRIMARY FOCUS
    3. Premium Anchor ($65+): All weblings bundle or "Everything + 6
  months email
    support" — creates decoy pricing that makes $39.95 tier look
  like "the sweet deal"

    Optional Add-On (Not Required):
    - Setup Service ($9.99): Timothy deploys the webling live, sends
  login
    credentials, buyer just logs in and customizes. 5-10 minute
  turnaround. Completely
     optional. Buyer can skip this and deploy free using the
  tutorial.

    Messaging: "Want us to handle deployment? $9.99 and it's live in
  10 minutes. Or
    grab the free tutorial and do it yourself. We love you either
  way."

    MARKETPLACE UI DESIGN

    Homepage/Gallery:
    - Hero section: "Professional websites. Designed once.
  Customized by you. Owned
    forever."
    - Grid display: All weblings as cards (preview image, feature
  list, price, live
    demo link)
    - Filters: By category, price, features
    - Trust signals: "Buy once. Own forever." "Built-in editor. No
  coding." "Deployed
    in 10 minutes."

    Product Detail Page:
    - Hero image/screenshot of the webling
    - Interactive Sandbox: Visitor can click "Try the Editor" and
  test-drive the
    visual editor before buying (live demo of editor.html)
    - Feature list (what's included)
    - Live preview iframe (user sees the actual template running)
    - Social proof (if available: customer count, testimonials)
    - Two CTAs:
      a. "Buy Now ($39.95)" → Lemon Squeezy checkout
      b. "View Demo" → Full-page preview

    Checkout Flow (via Lemon Squeezy):
    - Email + payment info only (no account creation required)
    - Optional: Offer setup service ($9.99 add-on) in checkout
    - Post-purchase: Instant download link + welcome email with:

      - (If setup service bought) Deployment timeframe + your email
  for questions

    Admin Dashboard (for Timothy):
    - Decap CMS interface (no code required)
    - Form to add/edit weblings: name, description, price, category,
  features, preview
     image, demo URL
    - Changes publish automatically to marketplace
    - No need to touch Gumroad dashboard — it syncs through API

    ---
    WEBLING EDITOR EXPERIENCE

    Each webling ships with editor.html (or similar):
    - Split-screen: Controls on left, live preview on right
    - Visual controls: Color pickers, text inputs, image uploader
    - No code exposed to user
    - Export button: Creates final standalone HTML file
    - Works offline (no internet required to customize)

    Why This Matters: Differentiates from competitors. Buyers get
  what they pay for
    immediately.

    - Step-by-step video or annotated screenshots
    - "From Purchase to Live Website in 10 Minutes"
    - Every step crystal clear: download → unzip → open editor →
  customize → deploy
    - Keyboard shortcuts, troubleshooting, browser compatibility

    Trust & Care Messaging:
    - "Want to deploy it yourself? Here's the free guide. We believe
  in you."
    - "Need us to handle it? $9.99 and it's done."
    - "You own the HTML forever. No subscriptions. No lock-in."

    GO-TO-MARKET: TikTok Strategy (Phase 1)

    Content Hook Templates (from GemmyB research):
    1. The Mistake: "Stop paying $50/month for website builders..."
    2. The Transformation: "Watch me customize a professional
  website in 60
    seconds..."
    3. The Secret: "This is the best $39 investment for small
  businesses..."

    Format: Screen recording of editor in action (click headline →
  type new one →
    instant update).

    UGC-style (raw, authentic). Link in bio → axxilak.com → live
  demo → checkout.

    Post weekly. Affiliate toolkit on Lemon Squeezy (invite micro-
  influencers, give
    them 20% commission).

    ---

    ---
    SUCCESS METRICS (Phase 1)

    - Marketplace live and accepting orders

    - Zero support complaints about the tutorial
    - Average customer deployment time: <15 minutes
    - Optional setup service: 30-50% attachment rate

    ---
    Critical Dependencies

    - 2-3 weblings must be shipping-ready (no more than minor
  tweaks)
    - Tutorial must be genuinely excellent (invest time here)
    - Lemon Squeezy/Gumroad account created with proper product
  setup
    - Contact form routing tested end-to-end
    - Decap CMS configured so Timothy can manage products without
  asking for code help

    ---
    Open Questions for the Braid

    1. Should we start with Gumroad (simpler) or Lemon Squeezy
  (lower fees, more
    scalable)?
    2. Which 2-3 weblings are ready to ship first?
    3. Should optional setup service be $9.99 or different price?
    4. Who owns the manual setup work in Phase 1 (Timothy, or
  outsource)?
    5. Should we announce the marketplace before it's live, or
  stealth-launch and
    build TikTok momentum first?

    ---
    Guiding Principles

    - Excellence over speed. A slow, beautiful launch beats a fast,
  janky one.
    - Customer education is the moat. A great tutorial is worth more
  than a salesman.
    - Free + optional paid. Remove the friction while offering
  convenience.
    - Love first. The buyer feels genuinely cared for at every
  touchpoint.
