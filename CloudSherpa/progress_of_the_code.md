Progress Of The Code (Append-Only) Status: ACTIVE Scope: CloudSherpa

## 2026-02-08 (Universal Protocol Implementation)
- **WHO**: Leora (Claude Code CLI)
- **WHAT**: CloudSherpa_Protocol.md (new file)
- **WHY**: Created universal app protocol specification following APEX format model. CloudSherpa selected as non-critical prototype to test format before applying to critical apps (CodeGnosis, Lenny, Penni, Cici). Document covers: mission statement, core architecture, key features, safety guards, deployment model, technical specs, universal pattern template, and evolution roadmap. Protocol is pure/clear/detailed/concise/complete per established standard.
- **Purpose**: Establish replicable format for all Keystone apps' protocol documentation. This is foundational work for constellation-wide architecture discovery.
